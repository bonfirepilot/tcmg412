DevOps has become increasingly more and more popular in recent years for a good reasons. 
It has a lot of benefits for a business that chooses to put the time into implementing this system into their business.
There are 5 benefits to companies that implement a DevOps strategy into their business and those are
1. Faster Deployment - This is important to a company as the faster you can deploy things like new processes and systems the more rapidly allowing a company to be more agile and compete with other companies which allows them to make more money and have a larger section of their market. 
2. Improved Customer Experience - When a company can develop solutions faster it helps them be better able to serve their customers. In a recent study on DevOps in organizations it found that 70% of businesses reported huge improvements in customer service thanks to DevOps. This is a big deal as customers are what pay for a companies services or products and being able to make them a priority means better service.
3. Better Morale - Morale is a crucial part of a good company. If your employees are unhappy with the communication in the company then employees are likley to experience lower morale which then affects the productivity of the company. Being able to improve that communication and have teams of employees work and communicate more effectivly is vital to the overall health of a company.
4. Time to Innovate - After you have improved your deployment and communication in an organization you will find that since things are being done faster that there is more time to do other things like innovating. Having more time in a company means you can brainstorm new ideas for products or services for the company. And since the communication will be better in the org you can communicate those ideas for new things a lot better than you could have before.
5. Faster Problem Solving - Being able to solve problems faster is another big benefit to DevOps because problems from a business standpoint are expensive. So solving problems faster is a huge plus as it saves the company money and manpower that can be used on other projects.
