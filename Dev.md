**Development**

In DevOps, the Development side of the chain normally consists of creation, planning, verifying and packaging. Development is the first side of the coin in the creation of the IT application or product, which means that they build the application/product from scratch using whichever programming languages, applications, or hardware that they need. Almost all companies in this day and age, use and critically need IT departments, along with the development of new programs and creation of digital infrastructure. Without IT to help companies create new apps and internet services, they would be unable to keep up with the technological advances of their competitors and they would become obsolete and go out of business. 
  
The development side of things has more to do with the actual code needed for a project rather than making the product operational. These are the people who write the code and set up the structure/foundation for the application/product they are producing. If the development team does not complete their work efficiently, then the operations team cannot get the application/product up and running. This role in a company normally consists of software engineers which requires a degree in Computer Science or Software Engineering.
