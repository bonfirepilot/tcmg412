**DevOps Manifesto**

We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

Working software over comprehensive documentation

Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Responding to change over following a plan

While there is value in the items on the right,
we value the items on the left more.

The words above are echoed from the Agile Manifesto, which goes hand in hand with many of the principles involved in DevOps practices. Much like agile, DevOps is a cultural and outlook change rather than a physical one. The principles espoused by forerunners in the field ring true to this day, and are the basis from which many successful companies have derived their framework and culture.
