While DevOps was thought of in early 2000's, it was finalized towards 2009 and the credit was given to Patrick Debois. Patrick was always interested in IT from every perspective but around 2007 he noticed the differences between Development and Operations. He wanted to create an event to raise awareness of the practices and concepts he associated with successful teams, and the idea of DevOps became popularized.

This came out to be the event DevOps Day, which lead to the creation of the idea of Developmental Operations or DevOps for short. He realized this was exactly the solution for which he had been looking for. Transforming your organization into DevOps culture can be very beneficial to any organization and is encouraged to do for any IT based group.
