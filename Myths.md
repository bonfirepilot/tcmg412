# DevOps Myths
![The Myths](https://www.sandhata.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/myths-1.jpg)

There are many misconceptions about DevOps, and that is due to it being such a broad concept. It is a cultural movement, but people
will try to condense it into a job title or buzzword. Here are a few DevOps myths.

## Myth 1: Devops Only Involves Developers and System Administrators

DevOps actually involves all aspects of the organization. It is a concept of working together using all of the necessary pieces for 
a project. From development to deployment, DevOps encourages collaboration and understanding between all employees.

## Myth 2: DevOps is a Team

By creating a DevOps "Team", one is not influencing the culture of the organization, but rather separating a team from the rest of 
the organization. If DevOps is a culture, it should spread throughout the group from the top down.

## Myth 3: DevOps is Only Relevant to Web Startups

While it is easy to recognize the benifits of collaboration, affinity, and tools in a small web startup, large enterprises can 
benefit from this culture of collaboration. It can turn weeks/months long processes into (relatively) quick fixes.
